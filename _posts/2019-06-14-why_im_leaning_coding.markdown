I started learning software development because I liked tinkering with my MySpace page back in the day and I don't know  any advanced math because I learned to program my calculator instead. Beyond that, I wanted a skillset that gives me a solid foundation for a carreer as I still continue to persue acting. I'm *gasp* approaching thirty and nannying isn't going to cut it for much longer. I like the puzzle/problem solving of coding as well as the freedom it will give me. 

TL;DR I'm turning 30 this year and need a plan.
