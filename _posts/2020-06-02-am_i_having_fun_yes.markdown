Although challenging, this was the most fun I've had with a project yet. I felt like I understood how all the pieces work together and it was so exciting to build it myself. I got to integrate frontend and backend and build a whole app! I also felt like this was the first time that I am inspired to go back and tinker with this code now that the project is done.
