I come from a family of plumbers, which I've learned just means that they're problem solvers. 

Coding, like plumbing, is problem solving. I use critical thinking skills to figure out how to build what I need with the tools that I have. And honestly, I think that's really fun. I love to see how efficient, concise, and reusable I can make my code. It's a fun puzzle.

I like to think about the problem before trying anything. I run through options, tools, and potential solutions in my head before I start. It reminds me of the times growing up that I would watch my uncles brainstorm how they're going to run an AC vent between floors where clearance is tight. 

I believe that this mindset, of having fun while solving a puzzle, will allow me to continue to grow as a coder and enjoy the ride.
