I think I learned a lot doing this project. I learned to make an api, work with javascript, and built on my Ruby and Rails knowledge.
A culmination!

I worked through bugs by finding the core of the problem, sought help from peers to understand my problems in a single page application that I conceptualized from start to finish.

This project was tough, but in the end, *very* rewarding.
