This has been a steep learning curve for me. I oscillate between having tons of fun and being very lost.
This project used the skills that I've learnd all the way from methods through to MVC to build an application that uses CRUD to interact with a user and their sewing projects.
From the little that I've seen of Rails, I'm very excited!
