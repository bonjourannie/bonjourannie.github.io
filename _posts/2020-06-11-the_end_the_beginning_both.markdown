I didn't expect to be this proud. I came into this program nearly a year ago with essentailly no knowledge of coding. Like learning how to ride a bike, I have to go out on my own now. Struggle, learn, correct, fail, and fail faster. (because, as Steve Jobs liked to quote without credit to Picasso, "good artists copy, great artists steal")

Now standing at the end of the program, and the beginning of my career search, I can see a little better how much I've learned.

A year ago, I didn't know what a console was, let alone methods, classes, or action creators.

I'm excited to utilize newfound skills in the workplace.
